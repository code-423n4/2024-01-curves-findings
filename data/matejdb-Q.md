Any user can add any ```curvesTokenSubject``` to his ```_addOwnedCurvesTokenSubject``` subject array by simply calling ```buyCurvesToken``` with amount argument set to 0 (zero).

He will not have to pay anything since the price amounts to 0 (zero).

This does not lead to any major vulnerabilities hence the QA tag.
