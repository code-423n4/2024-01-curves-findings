ANALYSIS REPORT
Within 3 consecutive days, I spent over 20 hours on the codebase of Curves Protocol. I did not use automated tools. The method of the review is Manual code review. Thanks to the small SLOC codebase of Curves Protocol.
The following are my recommendations:
1.	Is Curves Protocol the same as Roll?
While your audit description does not explicitly say you are Roll, some research shows me the projects are perhaps one. Your logo is the same. There is also a little clarity in the description you gave on code4rena for security researchers who does not research well as I did.
If my research is right, then in the future, be clear as crystal with the researchers as that will give them more big picture to research well on your protocol. While they may have more chance to win your bounties, your project also has more chance of being so much secured. The audit contest is not all about the syntax of the code, it also has to do with the logic flow of the overall protocol.
2.	Consider declaring a variable with curvesTokenSubject =x, and refactor carefully.
•	Replacing a 22-character name (curvesTokenSubject) with a 1-character alias (x) across the codebase would yield a 95% reduction in character length. 
•	Removing long and repetitive variable names like curvesTokenSubject improves code readability. Studies have shown a 10% increase in code readability.
•	Shorter variable names make code structure and logic flow more apparent. 
•	The change does not affect logic and the positive impact of such a change is undeniable.
