   - The Owner role has significant administrative capabilities, including assigning the FeeSplitter and TokenFactory. This concentration of power introduces a central point of control.

2. **Manager Role Dependency:**
   - While the protocol aims for decentralized governance through transitioning managerial responsibilities to a DAO, the initial dependency on the Manager role introduces centralization risks.

3. **Smart Contract Ownership:**
   - The reliance on a singular Owner for critical functionalities raises concerns about potential abuse or mismanagement, posing risks to the overall security and functionality of the protocol.

4. **Limited Managerial Decentralization:**
   - Despite supporting multiple managers, the protocol currently lacks full decentralization in managerial decision-making, emphasizing the need for a robust DAO implementation.

5. **Token Export Limitations:**
   - The token export functionality, while promoting interoperability, imposes restrictions on the divisibility of tokens when transitioning to ERC20 format, potentially limiting liquidity.

6. **ETH Payment Exclusivity:**
   - The protocol exclusively supports payments in ETH, introducing a degree of centralization by favoring one specific currency.

Mitigation strategies for centralization risks involve progressively transitioning governance to decentralized models, implementing multi-signature solutions, and fostering broader community involvement in decision-making processes.
