### 1. Unnecessary tracking of Curve -> Subject with the mapping `externalCurvesToSubject`

The externalCurvesToSubject mapping appears to serve the purpose of storing key-value pairs associating external curves with their respective subjects. However, if it does not have any prominent or functional role in the current codebase, removing it will not only save gas but could improve code simplicity and clarity.

### 2. Emit events for significant storage changes.

Events are useful for UI changes and user notifications. The code base overall can use more use of events to update the UI and participants. One of the most important aspects that must emit events, are when system state and functionality are changed. 

```
    function setFeeRedistributor(address feeRedistributor_) external onlyOwner {
+       address old      = feeRedistributor;
        feeRedistributor = FeeSplitter(payable(feeRedistributor_));
+       emit UpdateFeeRedistributor(old, feeRedistributor_);
    }
```

### 3. Verify early to quit early
```
    function buyCurvesTokenWhitelisted(
        address curvesTokenSubject,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes32[] memory proof
    ) public payable {
        if (
            presalesMeta[curvesTokenSubject].startTime == 0 ||
            presalesMeta[curvesTokenSubject].startTime <= block.timestamp
        ) revert PresaleUnavailable();

+       verifyMerkle(curvesTokenSubject, msg.sender, proof);

        presalesBuys[curvesTokenSubject][msg.sender] += amount;
        uint256 tokenBought = presalesBuys[curvesTokenSubject][msg.sender];
        if (tokenBought > presalesMeta[curvesTokenSubject].maxBuy) revert ExceededMaxBuyAmount();

-       verifyMerkle(curvesTokenSubject, msg.sender, proof);
        _buyCurvesToken(curvesTokenSubject, amount);
    }
```
Here it is better to check if the valid proof is provided or not, in early stage of execution itself.

```
    function getClaimableFees(address token, address account) public view returns (uint256) {
        TokenData storage data = tokensData[token];
        uint256 balance = balanceOf(token, account);
+       if (balance == 0) return 0;
        uint256 owed = (data.cumulativeFeePerToken - data.userFeeOffset[account]) * balance;
        return (owed / PRECISION) + data.unclaimedFees[account];
    }
```
If the balance is 0 return 0.

### 4. Skip execution flow for particular inputs in transfer_ function.
```
    function _transfer(address curvesTokenSubject, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (amount > curvesTokenBalance[curvesTokenSubject][from]) revert InsufficientBalance();

        // If transferring from oneself, skip adding to the list
-       if (from != to) {
+       if (from != to && amount != 0) {
            _addOwnedCurvesTokenSubject(to, curvesTokenSubject);
+           curvesTokenBalance[curvesTokenSubject][from] = curvesTokenBalance[curvesTokenSubject][from] - amount;
+.          curvesTokenBalance[curvesTokenSubject][to] = curvesTokenBalance[curvesTokenSubject][to] + amount;
        }

-       curvesTokenBalance[curvesTokenSubject][from] = curvesTokenBalance[curvesTokenSubject][from] - amount;
-       curvesTokenBalance[curvesTokenSubject][to] = curvesTokenBalance[curvesTokenSubject][to] + amount;

        emit Transfer(curvesTokenSubject, from, to, amount);
    }
```
When transferring tokens few cases like if,
- to == from then no need to do anything, just emit an event
- amount == 0 then just skip the flow of transfer and emit event.
