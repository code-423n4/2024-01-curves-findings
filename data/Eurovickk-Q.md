Curves.sol
1)Ensure that functions handling fund transfers (buyCurvesToken, sellCurvesToken, etc.) properly handle exceptions and appropriately handle the return value of the call.

function buyCurvesToken(address curvesTokenSubject, uint256 amount) public payable {
    uint256 startTime = presalesMeta[curvesTokenSubject].startTime;
    if (startTime != 0 && startTime >= block.timestamp) revert(SaleNotOpen());

    // Add a check for the success of the transfer
    if (!_buyCurvesToken(curvesTokenSubject, amount)) {
        revert("Failed to buy Curves token");
    }
}

function _buyCurvesToken(address curvesTokenSubject, uint256 amount) internal returns (bool) {
    // ... existing logic ...

    // Ensure the transfer is successful
    (bool success, ) = curvesTokenSubject.call{value: msg.value}("");
    return success;
}

2)Reusability:  Factorize common logic into a separate internal function to avoid code duplication.

function getPriceAfterFee(address curvesTokenSubject, uint256 amount, bool isBuy) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 price = isBuy ? getBuyPrice(curvesTokenSubject, amount) : getSellPrice(curvesTokenSubject, amount);
    (, , , , uint256 totalFee) = getFees(price);
    return isBuy ? price + totalFee : price - totalFee;
}
Then, you can call getPriceAfterFee from both getBuyPriceAfterFee and getSellPriceAfterFee.


FeeSplitter.sol

1)In the claimFees and batchClaiming functions, ensure proper handling of exceptions during ether transfers. If the transfer fails, users could be stuck in a state where they are owed money but cannot claim it. You can use a pattern like a withdrawal pattern where users explicitly withdraw their funds.

function claimFees(address token) external {
    updateFeeCredit(token, msg.sender);
    uint256 claimable = getClaimableFees(token, msg.sender);
    if (claimable == 0) revert NoFeesToClaim();
    tokensData[token].unclaimedFees[msg.sender] = 0;

    // Set the claimed flag to true before transferring funds
    bool claimed = false;

    // Use a modifier to check if funds have been claimed
    modifier ensureFundsNotClaimed() {
        require(!claimed, "Funds already claimed");
        _;
        claimed = true;
    }

    // Use a separate function for withdrawal
    function withdraw() internal ensureFundsNotClaimed {
        // Use a secure transfer pattern
        (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: claimable}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }

    // Withdraw funds
    withdraw();

    emit FeesClaimed(token, msg.sender, claimable);
}

This pattern ensures that the claimed flag is set to true before transferring funds. The ensureFundsNotClaimed modifier checks if the funds have been claimed before allowing the function to execute. This way, if the transfer fails, the funds remain unclaimed, and users can attempt the withdrawal again. You can apply a similar pattern to the batchClaiming function by creating a separate withdraw function and using the ensureFundsNotClaimed modifier.

2)In the addFees function, be aware that you are using msg.value directly. Make sure this is what you really want. If the contract is expected to receive ether, it's fine. However, if a certain amount of tokens is expected to be sent, this could cause confusion. The function takes an address parameter called token, but it's important to note that in this context, the token parameter does not represent an ERC-20 token address; instead, it's just a naming choice for the parameter


function claimFees(address token) external {
    updateFeeCredit(token, msg.sender);
    uint256 claimable = getClaimableFees(token, msg.sender);
    if (claimable == 0) revert NoFeesToClaim();
    tokensData[token].unclaimedFees[msg.sender] = 0;

    // Use a secure transfer pattern
    (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: claimable}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");

    emit FeesClaimed(token, msg.sender, claimable);


Security.sol

1)It seems like you intended to use the assignment operator (=) in your modifiers, but you've used the equality operator (==).

pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

contract Security {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => bool) public managers;

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the owner");
        _;
    }

    modifier onlyManager() {
        require(managers[msg.sender], "Not a manager");
        _;
    }

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        managers[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function setManager(address manager_, bool value) public onlyOwner {
        managers[manager_] = value;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address owner_) public onlyOwner {
        owner = owner_;
    }
}

A)Replaced == with require in the onlyOwner and onlyManager modifiers to check the condition and revert if it's not met.
B)Added error messages in the require statements to provide more information about the failure.
