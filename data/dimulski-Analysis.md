## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
During this 8-days audit the codebase was tested in various different ways. The first step after cloning the repository was ensuring that all tests provided pass successfully when run. After that I set up a foundry environment in order to write tests using the foundry framework. Then began the phase when I got some high-level overview of the functionality by reading the code. There were some parts of the project that caught my attention. These parts were tested with Foundry POCs. Some of them were false positives, others turned out to be true positives that were reported. The contest's main page does provides some context for the main idea of the Curves protocol, and points to some useful explanations of the frind.tech protocol, from where Curves took the main idea - tokenazing user accounts, and then tried to build upon it by adding new features.
