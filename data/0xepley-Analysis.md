## a) The approach I would follow when reviewing the code

First, by examining the scope of the code, I determined my code review and analysis strategy.
https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-01-curves

Accordingly, I analyzed and audited the subject in the following steps;

| Number |Stage |Details|Information|
|:--|:----------------|:------|:------|
|1|Compile and Run Test|[Installation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-curves/blob/main/install.md)|Test and installation structure is simple, cleanly designed|
|2|Architecture Review| [Curves](https://medium.com/valixconsulting/friend-tech-smart-contract-breakdown-c5588ae3a1cf) |Provides a basic architectural teaching for General Architecture|
|3|Graphical Analysis  |Graphical Analysis with [Solidity-metrics](https://github.com/ConsenSys/solidity-metrics)|A visual view has been made to dominate the general structure of the codes of the project.|
|4|Slither Analysis  | [Slither Report](https://github.com/crytic/slither)| Slither report of the project for some basic analysis|
|5|Test Suits|[Tests](https://medium.com/valixconsulting/friend-tech-smart-contract-breakdown-c5588ae3a1cf)|In this section, the scope and content of the tests of the project are analyzed.|
|6|Manuel Code Review|[Scope](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-curves?tab=readme-ov-file#scope)||
|7|Infographic|[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)|Tried to make Visual drawings to understand the hard-to-understand mechanisms|
|8|Special focus on Areas of  Concern|[Areas of Concern](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-curves?tab=readme-ov-file#attack-ideas-where-to-look-for-bugs)|Code where I should focus more|

## b) Analysis of the code base

The most important summary in analyzing the code base is the stacking of codes to be analyzed.
In this way, many predictions can be made, including the difficulty levels of the contracts, which one is more important for the auditor, the features they contain that are important for security (payable functions, uses assembly, etc.), the audit cost of the project, and the time to be allocated to the audit;
Uses Consensys Solidity Metrics

-  **Language:** language in which of the source is written
-  **nSLOC:** normalized source lines of code (only source-code lines; no comments, no blank lines)
-  **Comment Lines:** lines containing single or block comments
-  **Blank Lines:** Blank Lines in the source file
-  **Total Lines:** Total number of lines in the file

## c) Test analysis
### What did the project do differently? ;
-   1) It can be said that the developers of the project did a quality job, there is a test structure consisting of tests with quality content. In particular, tests have been written successfully.

-   2) Overall line coverage percentage provided by your tests : 99.56

### What could they have done better?

-  1) In order to understand the test scenarios and develop more effective test scenarios, the following bob, alice and other roles are can be defined one by one, in this way role definitions increase the quality and readability in tests

```solidity

 // Sample labels
vm.label(bob, 'bob');
vm.label(alice, 'alice');
vm.label(DEPLOYER, 'deployer');
vm.label(USD_OWNER, 'usd owner');
vm.label(POOL_PROXY, 'lending pool');
```


-  3) If we look at the test scope and content of the project with a systematic checklist, we can see which parts are good and which areas have room for improvement As a result of my analysis, those marked in green are the ones that the project has fully achieved. The remaining areas are the development areas of the project in terms of testing ;
