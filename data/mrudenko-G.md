# Curves Smart Contract Optimization Report

## Optimization Strategies
This report outlines several strategies to improve gas efficiency and overall performance of the `Curves` smart contract.

### 1. Minimize State Variable Writes
**Issue:** Frequent state variable writes increase gas costs.
**Original Code:**
```solidity
curvesTokenBalance[curvesTokenSubject][from] -= amount;
curvesTokenBalance[curvesTokenSubject][to] += amount;
```

Optimized code
```solidity
uint256 fromBalance = curvesTokenBalance[curvesTokenSubject][from];
uint256 toBalance = curvesTokenBalance[curvesTokenSubject][to];
fromBalance -= amount;
toBalance += amount;
curvesTokenBalance[curvesTokenSubject][from] = fromBalance;
curvesTokenBalance[curvesTokenSubject][to] = toBalance;
```

2. Replace External Calls with Library Functions
Issue: External calls are more expensive than internal calls.
Original Code: Using Strings.toString() from OpenZeppelin.
Optimized Code:
```
function uintToString(uint v) internal pure returns (string memory str) {
    // Implementation...
}
```
3. Pack State Variables
Issue: Unoptimized storage of state variables.
Original Code:
```
struct FeesEconomics {
    uint256 protocolFeePercent;
    // Other variables...
}
```
4. Use Short-Circuiting in Boolean Expressions
Issue: Inefficient order of conditions in boolean expressions.
Original Code:
```
if (a + b + c > d || e == address(0)) { ... }
```
Optimized Code:
```
if (e == address(0) || a + b + c > d) { ... }
```
5. Use calldata instead of memory for External Functions
Issue: Inefficient use of memory in external functions.
Original Code:
```
function verifyMerkle(address curvesTokenSubject, address caller, bytes32[] memory proof) public view { ... }
```
Optimized code:
```
function verifyMerkle(address curvesTokenSubject, address caller, bytes32[] calldata proof) public view { ... }
```
6. Optimize Arithmetic Operations
Issue: Inefficient arithmetic operations.
Original Code: Complex calculations in getPrice.
Optimized Code: Rearrange calculations to minimize divisions and multiplications.

7. Cache Frequently Accessed Storage Variables
Issue: Repeated storage access increases gas costs.
Original Code: Direct access to presalesMeta[curvesTokenSubject].
Optimized Code: Cache presalesMeta[curvesTokenSubject] in a local variable.
