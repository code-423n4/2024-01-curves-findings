### Lack of Check for Zero Deposit
***The function lacks a specific check for zero-value deposits. While the existing condition amount % 1 ether != 0 is designed to prevent non-integer deposits, it does not handle the case where the deposit amount is zero. This oversight could lead to unexpected behavior or may be exploited for unintended use.***

***The absence of a check for zero-value deposits means the function allows deposits of 0 units of the external token. This might lead to unintended behavior, especially if the contract's logic or external interactions rely on non-zero deposits.***

***Include a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that the deposit amount is non-zero before proceeding with further validations or interactions.***
